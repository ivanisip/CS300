## Reflection

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
I worked on organizing course data for an advising system.  
I needed a way to store courses, search through them, and display details quickly.  
My goal was to show course details and prerequisites in the right order.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**  
I tried using different data structures like vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees.  
I tested each one to see which could search and sort data faster.  
This helped me learn that the right data structure makes a program work more efficiently.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
I broke the project into smaller parts and worked on one piece at a time.  
I tested my code with sample data to catch and fix errors quickly.  
This step-by-step approach helped me solve problems as they came up.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
I learned to plan my work before I start coding.  
I organized my tasks clearly, which made it easier to build a working system.  
This project showed me that taking small steps helps me design better software.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I now write code that is split into clear, small pieces.  
I use simple names for my variables and functions so the code is easy to follow.  
This approach makes it easier to update or fix my code in the future.
